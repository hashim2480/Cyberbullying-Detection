# Cyberbullying-Detection
Cyberbullying Detection is a Flask-based web app using Python and scikit-learn. It applies NLP techniques and a tuned Linear SVC model (LinearSVCTuned.pkl) to classify online text in real-time, helping identify harmful or abusive content and reduce the impact of cyberbullying.
The Cyberbullying Detection System is a machine learning-based web application developed using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn. It aims to automatically detect harmful or abusive text on online platforms.

The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction to prepare data for training. A Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model is trained on labeled datasets and optimized to improve accuracy. The final tuned model is saved as LinearSVCTuned.pkl for real-time predictions.

With the help of Flask, a lightweight web framework, the trained model is deployed as a simple interactive web application. Users can enter text into the interface, and the system will instantly classify whether the text contains cyberbullying content or not.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web technologies, providing a practical solution for moderating online interactions.
